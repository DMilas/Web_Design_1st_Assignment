        <h3>The art of debugging</h3>

        <p>
            As a software developer often you are tasked to find,
            analyze and debug a certain feature on the product / software
            you are currently working on. It may be a personal project or
            you might work in an international company with numerous projects live at
            the same time. Nevertheless the issue remains that most software products
            have bugs that hinder either the user experience or the functionality of
            the software its self. So in case something like that does come up what can
            you do to fix the situation at hand.
