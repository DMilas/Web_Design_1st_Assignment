        <h3>Actually resolving the bug</h3>

        <p>
            Of course explaining the full process on resolving a bug cant be done as every software project is different
            in its own unique way. Instead we are going to suggest two very easy ways to provide a temporary fix to the
            issue at hand.
        </p>
        <p>Firstly , especially if the bug it is not severe, a temporary fix can be placed in action either by
            commenting a code block or by redirecting the work flow of the software to some other similar usability.
        </p>
        <p>In the other hand , if the bug is severe the first order of business should be to revert the changes made to
            the code to its previous version to avoid escalation of the problem. After that visit the branch you were
            working on and find the problematic piece of code and fix it. After that make sure that the code is properly
            reviewed , merged and deployed.
