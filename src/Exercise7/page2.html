        <h3>Determine the severity of the bug</h3>

        <p>
            Before any developer proceeds to fix a said bug he/she must assess the severity of the issue. Not all bugs
            are created equally and not all of them impact the usability of the software the same.</p>
        <p>Most of the time bugs are an unforeseen behavior either of the user or the software itself. Thus in many
            cases the severity is actually low and it can be circumvented by placing a temporary fix or deactivating a
            part of the usability itself.
        </p>
        <p>But now and the again a bug may come up that severely impact the software performance and it must be dealt
            immediately. Such bugs mostly occur from hastily written code that has not been reviewed or has been
            deployed with out proper merging of the branch.
